# SettlePaisa Service Monitoring & High Availability

## üéØ Mission Critical Requirement
**The recon service and dashboard must NEVER go down. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Start with Full Monitoring
```bash
cd /Users/shantanusingh/ops-dashboard
./start-with-monitoring.sh
```

This script will:
- Start all 5 services (Frontend, Recon API, Overview API, PG API, Bank API)
- Monitor health every 30 seconds
- Auto-restart failed services (up to 3 attempts each)
- Provide real-time status updates

### Install as System Service (Auto-start on boot)
```bash
./scripts/install-service-monitor.sh
```

## üìä Service Architecture

### Core Services
1. **Frontend** (Port 5174) - React dashboard
2. **Recon API** (Port 5103) - **CRITICAL** - Main reconciliation engine
3. **Overview API** (Port 5105) - Dashboard overview data
4. **PG API** (Port 5101) - Mock payment gateway data
5. **Bank API** (Port 5102) - Mock bank data

### Monitoring Components
- **Service Monitor** - Continuous health checks & auto-restart
- **Health Checker** - Deep functionality verification
- **System Service** - LaunchAgent for auto-start on boot

## üîß Management Commands

### Service Control
```bash
# Start all services with monitoring
./start-with-monitoring.sh

# Check health of all services
./scripts/health-checker.sh

# View monitor logs
tail -f /tmp/service-monitor.log

# Stop monitoring (services continue running)
pkill -f service-monitor.sh

# Emergency restart all services
./start-services.sh
```

### System Service Control
```bash
# Start system service
launchctl start com.settlepaisa.servicemonitor

# Stop system service  
launchctl stop com.settlepaisa.servicemonitor

# Check status
launchctl list | grep servicemonitor

# View system service logs
tail -f /tmp/service-monitor-stdout.log
```

## üö® Failure Handling

### Automatic Recovery
- **Health Checks**: Every 30 seconds
- **Auto-restart**: Up to 3 attempts per service
- **Restart Delay**: 10 seconds between attempts
- **Graceful Handling**: Services restarted individually

### Alert System
- Failed restarts logged to `/tmp/critical-alerts.log`
- Monitor crashes trigger automatic restart
- PID tracking for all services

### Recovery Scenarios

1. **Single Service Failure**
   - Service automatically restarted within 30 seconds
   - Zero downtime for other services
   - Logs indicate restart reason

2. **Multiple Service Failures**
   - Each service restarted independently
   - Monitor prioritizes critical services (Recon API first)
   - Dashboard may briefly show loading states

3. **Complete System Failure**
   - System service auto-starts on boot
   - All services initialized in correct order
   - Health verification before marking as ready

4. **Monitor Failure**
   - Monitoring script itself is monitored by startup script
   - LaunchAgent ensures monitor restarts on crash
   - Multiple layers of redundancy

## üìÅ Log Files

### Service Logs
- `/tmp/service-monitor.log` - Main monitor activity
- `/tmp/recon-api.log` - Recon API output
- `/tmp/frontend.log` - Frontend dev server
- `/tmp/overview-api.log` - Overview API output
- `/tmp/pg-api.log` - PG API output
- `/tmp/bank-api.log` - Bank API output

### System Logs
- `/tmp/service-monitor-stdout.log` - System service output
- `/tmp/service-monitor-stderr.log` - System service errors
- `/tmp/critical-alerts.log` - Critical failure alerts

### PID Files
- `/tmp/frontend.pid`
- `/tmp/recon-api.pid`
- `/tmp/overview-api.pid`
- `/tmp/pg-api.pid`
- `/tmp/bank-api.pid`

## üéõÔ∏è Health Check Details

### Frontend Verification
- Port 5174 connectivity
- React app loading
- SettlePaisa branding present

### Recon API Verification (CRITICAL)
- Health endpoint `/recon/health` returns "healthy"
- Demo job endpoint functional
- Request processing working

### API Services Verification
- Health endpoints responding
- Basic connectivity confirmed
- Service-specific functionality

## ‚ö° Performance Tuning

### Resource Limits
- Each service monitored independently
- Memory usage tracked in health checks
- CPU usage logged for optimization

### Optimization Settings
- Health check interval: 30 seconds (adjustable)
- Restart attempts: 3 per service (configurable)
- Restart delay: 10 seconds (tunable)
- Connection timeout: 5 seconds

## üîí Security & Reliability

### Process Isolation
- Each service runs in separate process
- Failure of one service doesn't affect others
- Clean shutdown handling

### Resource Management
- PID tracking for proper cleanup
- Port management to prevent conflicts
- Log rotation to prevent disk issues

### Monitoring Redundancy
- Multiple monitoring layers
- System-level service for boot persistence
- Manual override capabilities

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port Already in Use**
   ```bash
   # Kill process on specific port
   lsof -ti:5103 | xargs kill -9
   ```

2. **Service Won't Start**
   ```bash
   # Check logs for specific service
   tail -f /tmp/recon-api.log
   ```

3. **Monitor Not Working**
   ```bash
   # Restart monitor manually
   ./scripts/service-monitor.sh
   ```

4. **System Service Issues**
   ```bash
   # Reinstall system service
   ./scripts/install-service-monitor.sh
   ```

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Complete Reset**
   ```bash
   # Kill all services
   pkill -f "5101|5102|5103|5105|5174"
   # Start fresh
   ./start-with-monitoring.sh
   ```

2. **Recon API Emergency Restart**
   ```bash
   # Critical service priority restart
   lsof -ti:5103 | xargs kill -9
   cd services/recon-api && node index.js &
   ```

## üìà Monitoring Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
- Service uptime percentage
- Restart frequency
- Response time for health checks
- Resource utilization

### Success Criteria
- **99.9% uptime** for recon service
- **< 30 second** recovery time
- **Zero data loss** during restarts
- **Automatic recovery** from all failure modes
