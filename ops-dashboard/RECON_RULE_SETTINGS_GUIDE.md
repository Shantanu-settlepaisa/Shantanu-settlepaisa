# Recon Rule Settings - Feature Guide

## Overview
The Recon Rule Settings feature allows you to configure and manage reconciliation matching rules for the SettlePaisa payment gateway. This is a powerful rule engine that determines how transactions are matched between your Payment Gateway (PG) and Bank statements.

## Rule Configuration Tabs

When you select a rule, you'll see 6 tabs on the right panel:

### Tab 1: **Definition** üìã
**Purpose**: Core matching logic configuration

**Settings**:
- **Match Chain**: Sequential steps for matching PG ‚Üí Bank records
  - Example: `["UTR", "amount", "date"]` means:
    1. First, try to match by UTR (Unique Transaction Reference)
    2. If UTR doesn't match, fall back to amount + date
    3. Each step narrows down potential matches
  
- **Scope**: Who does this rule apply to?
  - **Global**: All transactions (default)
  - **Custom**: Specific merchant, acquirer, or payment mode
  - Example: Create a stricter rule for high-value merchants

**When to Edit**:
- Adding new matching fields (RRN, Transaction ID, etc.)
- Creating merchant-specific rules
- Changing match priority order

---

### Tab 2: **Tolerances** üéØ
**Purpose**: Define acceptable differences during matching

**Settings**:
- **Amount Tolerance (paise)**: Absolute difference allowed
  - Example: `100` = ‚Çπ1.00 difference is acceptable
  - Use case: Gateway fees, rounding differences

- **Amount Tolerance (%)**: Percentage-based difference
  - Example: `0.5` = 0.5% variance allowed
  - Use case: High-value transactions where ‚Çπ1 is negligible

- **Date Tolerance (days)**: How many days apart can dates be?
  - Example: `1` = Transaction can be ¬±1 day from bank date
  - Use case: Settlement delays, timezone differences

**When to Edit**:
- High false positives (too many exceptions)
- Gateway-specific settlement patterns
- Different tolerance for different payment modes

---

### Tab 3: **Exceptions** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Purpose**: Define what exceptions to raise when matching fails

**Settings**:
- **When**: Trigger condition (e.g., `AMOUNT_MISMATCH`, `UTR_NOT_FOUND`)
- **Reason**: Human-readable explanation
- **Severity**: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`

**Example Exception Mapping**:
```
When: AMOUNT_MISMATCH
Reason: "Amount difference detected"
Severity: HIGH
```

**When to Edit**:
- Customizing exception priorities
- Adding new exception types
- Routing specific errors to specific teams

---

### Tab 4: **De-dup** üõ°Ô∏è
**Purpose**: Handle duplicate records in bank feeds

**Settings**:
- **Dedup Key**: Field to identify duplicates (UTR, RRN, TXNID)
- **Window (hours)**: How far back to check for duplicates
  - Example: `24` = Look for duplicates in last 24 hours
  
- **Strategy**: 
  - **First Write Wins**: Keep the earliest record
  - **Latest**: Keep the most recent record

**When to Edit**:
- Bank sends duplicate records
- Multiple data sources for same transaction
- Webhook retry logic causing duplicates

---

### Tab 5: **Auto-actions** ‚ö°
**Purpose**: Automated responses to matching outcomes

**Settings**:
- **When**: Trigger condition
- **Action**: What to do automatically

**Example Auto-actions**:
```
When: MATCH_SUCCESS
Action: AUTO_APPROVE

When: AMOUNT_MISMATCH_UNDER_1_RUPEE
Action: FLAG_FOR_REVIEW
```

**When to Edit**:
- Automating exception resolution
- Creating approval workflows
- Reducing manual intervention

---

### Tab 6: **Versions** üïê
**Purpose**: View rule change history

**Display**:
- Version number
- Date of change
- Author (who made the change)
- Summary of changes

**Use case**:
- Audit trail
- Rollback to previous version
- Understanding rule evolution

---

## Rule Actions

### **Edit** ‚úèÔ∏è
- Click "Edit" button in rule header
- Modify any settings in the tabs
- Click "Save" to apply changes (increments version)
- Click "Cancel" to discard changes

### **Duplicate** üìã
- Creates a copy of the current rule
- Useful for creating variations
- Example: Copy "Global UTR Rule" ‚Üí Customize for specific merchant

### **Simulate** ‚ñ∂Ô∏è
- Tests the rule against past data (7-day window)
- Shows impact metrics:
  - **Matched**: How many more/fewer matches
  - **Unmatched**: How many more/fewer unmatched records
  - **Value Impact**: Additional reconciled amount (‚Çπ)
  
**Example Output**:
```
Matched: 1602 (+27)
Unmatched: 648 (-27)
Value Impact: +‚Çπ8,500
```

**Use case**: 
- Before publishing a rule to production
- A/B testing different matching strategies
- Estimating improvement from rule changes

## Rule Lifecycle

```
1. DRAFT ‚Üí Create and test rule
   ‚Üì
2. SIMULATE ‚Üí Verify impact on past data
   ‚Üì
3. CANARY ‚Üí Test on 5-10% of live traffic (optional)
   ‚Üì
4. LIVE ‚Üí Full production deployment
   ‚Üì
5. ARCHIVED ‚Üí Deactivate but keep for history
```

**Status Meanings**:
- **Draft** (Gray): Work in progress, not active
- **Canary** (Yellow): Testing on subset of transactions
- **Live** (Green): Active in production
- **Archived** (Red): Disabled, historical record

## Common Use Cases

5. Simulate to verify improvement
6. Publish to Live

### Use Case 2: **Handle Gateway Fee Differences**

2. Click "Duplicate"
3. Go to Tolerances tab
4. Set Amount Tolerance = 100 paise (‚Çπ1)

## Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Simulation**
Never publish a rule directly to Live. Always simulate first to avoid breaking existing matches.

### 2. **Use Descriptive Names**
- ‚ùå Bad: "Rule 1", "Test Rule"
- ‚úÖ Good: "High Value Strict (Merchant X)", "UPI Tolerance Rule"

### 3. **Version Control Your Rules**
Use Export feature regularly to backup your rule configurations.

### 4. **Test with Canary**
For high-impact changes, use Canary status to test on 5-10% of traffic first.

### 5. **Document Changes**
Use the description field to explain why a rule was created or modified.

### 6. **Delete Test Rules**
Clean up draft rules that are no longer needed to avoid clutter.

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Failed to create rule"
**Solution**: 
- Ensure Recon Rules API is running on port 5109
- Check browser console for detailed error
- Verify database connection

### Problem: Rule list not refreshing after create/delete
**Solution**: Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Problem: Simulate shows no impact
**Solution**: 
- Verify there's data in the simulation window (last 7 days)
- Check if rule scope matches available transactions
- Ensure match_chain fields exist in data

### Problem: Delete button not showing
**Solution**: 
- Ensure you're not in Edit mode (if editing, cancel first)
- Delete button is only visible when viewing a rule
