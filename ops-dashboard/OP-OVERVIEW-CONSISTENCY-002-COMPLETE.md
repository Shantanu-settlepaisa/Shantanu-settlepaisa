# OP-OVERVIEW-CONSISTENCY-002 Implementation Complete ✅

## Overview
All Overview metrics are now **transaction-first** and consistent. The Settlement Value tile has been fixed to show settled amount + settled transactions + batch count, all for the selected time range.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. New Data Structure (`OpsSnapshot`)
- **Transaction-centric metrics** across all tiles
- **Consistent time windows** for all calculations
- **Delta percentages** comparing to previous period
- **Settlement details**: Amount, transaction count, and batch count

### 2. Backend Service
- Created `computeOpsSnapshot()` function with proper SQL-like logic
- Calculates metrics for any time window (rangeStart, rangeEnd)
- Compares with previous period for trend calculations
- Returns structured data matching production requirements

### 3. Frontend Updates

#### Settlement Value Tile - FIXED ✅
Now displays:
- **Headline**: `₹98,23,400` (formatted amount in INR)
- **Context**: `11,234 settled txns across 156 batches — for Last 7 days`
- **Trend**: `↑ 12.3% vs previous period`

#### All Tiles Now Show:
- **Reconciliation**: `12,453 of 14,312 transactions matched — for Last 7 days`
- **Unmatched Value**: `1,859 unmatched transactions — for Last 7 days`
- **Open Exceptions**: `8 critical, 12 high — for Last 7 days`
- **Settlement Value**: `11,234 settled txns across 156 batches — for Last 7 days`

#### Settlement Progress - Transaction Based
Shows 4 stages with transaction counts:
- **Captured**: 14,312 txns
- **In Settlement**: 12,890 txns  
- **Settled to Bank**: 10,234 txns
- **Unsettled**: 2,078 txns

### 4. Live Updates After Manual Upload
- When recon completes, emits `ops:snapshot:refresh` event
- Overview page listens and auto-refreshes
- All metrics update without page reload
- Settlement data properly calculated from reconciled transactions

## Key Improvements

### Transaction-First Approach
- All metrics based on **transaction counts** not just amounts
- Settlement shows txns + amount + batches
- Progress bar uses transaction counts
- Consistent unit across all metrics

### Time Window Consistency
- Single time range selector controls all metrics
- Progress bar uses same window as tiles
- All deltas compare to previous equivalent period
- URL persists selected range

### Better Context
- Each tile shows what's being measured
- Formulas in tooltips explain calculations
- Clear "for {time range}" labels
- Proper Indian currency formatting (₹ with commas)

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `/src/types/opsSnapshot.ts` - New data structure
- `/src/hooks/useOpsSnapshot.ts` - Data fetching hook
- `/src/pages/ops/OverviewConsistent.tsx` - Updated Overview page
- `OP-OVERVIEW-CONSISTENCY-002-COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

### Modified Files:
- `/src/services/overview-aggregator.ts` - Added OpsSnapshot computation
- `/src/components/ManualUploadEnhanced.tsx` - Updates settlement data
- `/src/router.tsx` - Uses new Overview page

## Testing Instructions

1. **Visit Overview**: http://localhost:5174/ops/overview
   - See all metrics are transaction-based
   - Settlement Value shows txns + amount + batches

2. **Change Time Range**:
   - Use calendar dropdown to select different ranges
   - All tiles and progress update together
   - Trends show comparison to previous period

3. **Manual Upload Test**:
   - Go to http://localhost:5174/ops/recon
   - Upload PG and Bank files
   - Return to Overview - metrics auto-update
   - Settlement data reflects reconciled transactions

4. **Verify Settlement Tile**:
   - Shows amount in ₹ format
   - Displays transaction count
   - Shows batch count
   - All for selected time range

## Acceptance Criteria ✅

✅ All tiles derive from same window with transaction-first unit
✅ Settlement Value shows "₹amount" headline + "X settled txns across Y batches — for {range}"
✅ Trends change coherently when switching date range
✅ After manual upload, Overview refreshes without reload
✅ Progress bar uses transaction counts from same window

## Production Notes

The current implementation uses mock data. For production:
1. Replace `computeOpsSnapshot()` with actual SQL queries
2. Implement backend endpoint `/ops/metrics/snapshot`
3. Use real database for transaction/settlement/exception data
4. Store historical snapshots for accurate trend calculations

The SQL template provided in the requirements can be directly used with minor adjustments for your schema.
