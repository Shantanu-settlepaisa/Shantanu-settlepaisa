## Deployed Triggers (Verified in Database)

```sql
trigger_name                     | table_name                      | action_timing
---------------------------------+---------------------------------+--------------
trg_transaction_status_change    | sp_v2_transactions              | AFTER
trg_update_settlement_on_transfer| sp_v2_settlement_bank_transfers | AFTER
trg_auto_match_bank_statement    | sp_v2_bank_statement_entries    | BEFORE
```

✅ **All 3 triggers are LIVE in staging database**

---

## Test 1: Auto-Queue Trigger (Trigger #1) ✅ WORKING

### What We Did:
1. Created test transaction with ID: `TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336`
2. Status: PENDING
3. Updated status to RECONCILED

### SQL Commands Used:
```sql
-- Step 1: Create transaction
INSERT INTO sp_v2_transactions (
  transaction_id, merchant_id, amount_paise, status, 
  transaction_date, transaction_timestamp, source_type, source_name, payment_method, created_at
) VALUES (
  'TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336',
  'MERCH001',
  100000,
  'PENDING',
  CURRENT_DATE,
  NOW(),
  'MANUAL_UPLOAD',
  'TRIGGER_TEST',
  'UPI',
  NOW()
);

-- Step 2: Mark as RECONCILED (trigger fires here)
UPDATE sp_v2_transactions 
SET status = 'RECONCILED' 
WHERE transaction_id = 'TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336';
```

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS

**Queue Entry Created Automatically:**
```
 id | transaction_id              | merchant_id | amount_paise | status  | queued_at
----+-----------------------------+-------------+--------------+---------+---------------------------
  1 | TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336 | MERCH001    | 100000       | PENDING | 2025-10-07 12:13:48.228053
```

**Proof:**
- ✅ Status changed from PENDING → RECONCILED
- ✅ Queue entry created **automatically** (no manual intervention)
- ✅ Queue status = PENDING (waiting for processor)
- ✅ Queued at timestamp recorded

**Conclusion:** **Trigger #1 is 100% working!** When a transaction becomes RECONCILED, it's automatically queued for settlement.

## Test 2: Settlement Queue Processor (Wires #2 & #3)

### Service Status:
```
┌────┬────────────────────────────┬─────────┬────────┬──────────┬────────┬────────┐
│ id │ name                       │ mode    │ pid    │ uptime   │ status │ user   │
├────┼────────────────────────────┼─────────┼────────┼──────────┼────────┼────────┤
│ 8  │ settlement-queue-processor │ fork    │ 104302 │ online   │ ✅     │ ec2-user│
└────┴────────────────────────────┴─────────┴────────┴──────────┴────────┴────────┘
```

**Service Logs:**
```
[Settlement Queue] Starting queue processor...
[Settlement Queue] Listening for settlement events...
[Settlement Queue] Queue processor ready!
```

✅ **Service is running and healthy**

### Why No Processing Yet:
The processor is designed to batch transactions for efficiency:
- **Wait 5 minutes** OR
- **Wait for 100 transactions**

Current wait time: ~4 minutes (since queue entry created at 12:13:48)

**This is by design** - not a bug. In production with many transactions, batching is efficient.

## Existing Data in Staging

### Settlement Queue:
```
 id | transaction_id              | status  | queued_at              | processed_at
----+-----------------------------+---------+------------------------+-------------
  1 | TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336 | PENDING | 2025-10-07 12:13:48    | (waiting)
```
**1 transaction in queue, waiting for batch window**

### Recent Transactions (RECONCILED, not yet queued):
These were RECONCILED **before** the trigger was deployed, so they weren't auto-queued:

```
transaction_id     | merchant_id                          | amount_paise | status     | settlement_batch_id
-------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+------------+--------------------
STAGING_FINAL_TEST | UNKNOWN                              | 25000000     | RECONCILED | (null)
TXN202510060012    | MERCH001                             | 80050        | RECONCILED | (null)
TXN202510060014    | MERCH001                             | 95025        | RECONCILED | (null)
TXN202510060011    | MERCH001                             | 125000       | RECONCILED | (null)
TXN202510060013    | MERCH001                             | 200000       | RECONCILED | (null)
```

These can be **manually queued** or will be picked up by the old cron-based system.

### Recent Settlement Batches:
```
id                                   | merchant_id                          | total_transactions | net_amount | status           | created_at
-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------+------------+------------------+---------------------------
4c8569e8-25f4-4ca8-911e-0f5e2f3b7ae6 | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001 | 100                | 2301189    | PENDING_APPROVAL | 2025-10-06 22:57:01

8f98d327-60a3-42bd-8e3f-91e3c88136bb | 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440001 | 1                  | 492920     | COMPLETED        | 2025-10-05 15:59:23
```

Recent batches exist from the old manual/cron system.

### Bank Transfers (All with fake UTRs):
```
id                                   | settlement_batch_id                  | amount_paise | utr_number        | status    | created_at
-------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------+-------------------+-----------+---------------------------
e2f51a75-508f-4d20-b66c-120178c4a4a6 | e4874a00-a71f-4739-b101-702627abbbff | 328070       | UTR17594150213594 | COMPLETED | 2025-10-03 14:23:40
34b042db-52c9-4fbe-aa6f-6b286fa238f1 | a5867b57-7150-401e-816b-b73e0114c7f6 | 2308837      | UTR17594150219289 | COMPLETED | 2025-10-03 14:23:40
```

All 10 existing transfers have **fake SQL-generated UTRs** (not from real bank).

## What Happens Next (Waiting for 5-Minute Window)

**Current Time:** 12:17:28  
**Queue Entry Created:** 12:13:48  
**Expected Processing:** 12:18:48 (5 minutes after queue entry)

### When Processor Triggers:
1. ✅ Reads transaction from queue
2. ✅ Resolves merchant ID (MERCH001 is already VARCHAR)
3. ✅ Calculates settlement using V3 calculator
4. ✅ Creates settlement batch
5. ✅ Updates transaction status: RECONCILED → SETTLED
6. ✅ Logs reserve hold (Wire #4)
7. ✅ Logs commission audit (Wire #4)
8. ✅ Updates queue: PENDING → PROCESSED

### After Processing Complete:
We can then test:
- **Trigger #2** (bank transfer completion)
- **Trigger #3** (bank statement auto-match)
- **Monitoring views**

---

## Manual Test Commands (For Verification)

### Check Queue Status:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_settlement_queue 
WHERE transaction_id = 'TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336';
```

### Check Transaction Status:
```sql
SELECT 
  transaction_id,
  status,
  settlement_batch_id,
  settled_at
FROM sp_v2_transactions 
WHERE transaction_id = 'TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336';
```

### Check if Settlement Batch Created:
```sql
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_settlement_batches 
WHERE merchant_id = 'MERCH001' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 1;
```

### Check Reserve Ledger (Wire #4):
```sql
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_merchant_reserve_ledger 
WHERE merchant_id = 'MERCH001' 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

### Check Commission Audit (Wire #4):
```sql
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_commission_audit 
ORDER BY created_at DESC 
LIMIT 5;
```

---

## How to Force Immediate Processing (Bypass 5-Minute Wait)

### Option 1: Send Notification Manually
```sql
NOTIFY settlement_queue, '{"transaction_id": "TRIGGER_TEST_20251007121336", "merchant_id": "MERCH001"}';
```

### Option 2: Add More Transactions to Reach 100 Threshold
```sql
-- Create 99 more test transactions and mark them RECONCILED
-- This will trigger immediate processing
```

### Option 3: Restart Processor (Forces Check)
```bash
ssh ec2-user@staging "pm2 restart settlement-queue-processor"
```
