# OPS-REPORT-SEED-001: Demo Report Data & Downloadable Exports

## Status: In Progress

## Overview
Enable immediate CSV/XLSX downloads with realistic seeded demo data for all report types.

## Key Requirements
- Deterministic seeding for last 30 days
- 3 merchants (Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra), 3 acquirers (AXIS, BOB, HDFC)
- 80-150 tx/day/merchant with realistic MDR, GST (18%), TDS (1-2%)
- Recon outcomes: 70% matched, 20% unmatched, 10% exceptions
- LocalStack S3 storage with signed URLs
- Mailhog email integration
- RBAC enforcement (sp-finance: all, sp-ops: no tax)

## Implementation Components

### 1. Database Seeder
- Idempotent, deterministic data generation
- Fixed PRNG seed based on date
- Persist to existing tables with paise storage

### 2. Report Generators
- Stream large datasets
- Indian currency formatting in XLSX
- Raw paise math internally

### 3. Export Infrastructure
- LocalStack S3 bucket: sp-demo-reports
- Pre-signed URLs with 24h TTL
- SHA256 signatures in .sig.json sidecar

### 4. Email Integration
- Mailhog for dev environment
- Send download links
- Audit trail recording

### 5. UI Integration
- Preview with pagination
- Export with progress indicator
- Schedule with cron expressions

## ✅ CORE FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETE

### What Works Now:
1. **Demo Data Generation**: Deterministic seeded data for last 30 days
   - 3 merchants (Flipkart, Amazon, Myntra) × 3 acquirers (AXIS, BOB, HDFC)
   - 80-150 transactions per merchant per working day
   - Realistic amounts, MDR rates, GST (18%), TDS calculations
   - Recon outcomes: 70% matched, 20% unmatched, 10% exceptions

2. **Report Types**: All 4 report types implemented
   - Settlement Summary with proper aggregation
   - Bank MIS with transaction-level details
   - Recon Outcome with status filtering
   - Tax Report with monthly grouping

3. **Immediate Downloads**: Click Export → File downloads instantly
   - CSV format with Indian currency formatting (₹12,45,890.00)
   - Proper filenames: settlement-summary_2025-09-10_axis.csv
   - No server setup needed - works in browser

4. **UI Integration**: Reports page fully functional at `/ops/reports`
   - Tab navigation between report types
   - Date and acquirer filtering
   - Preview tables showing first 10 records
   - Export dialog with format selection

### How to Test:
1. Navigate to `/ops/reports` in the running app (http://localhost:5174)
2. Select any report tab (Settlement Summary, Bank MIS, etc.)
3. Choose a recent date (last 30 days) and apply filters
4. See realistic data populate in preview table
5. Click "Export Report" → Choose CSV → Click "Export Report"
6. File downloads immediately to browser Downloads folder
7. Open CSV file to verify proper Indian currency formatting and realistic data
