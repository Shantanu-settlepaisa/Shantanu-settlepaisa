# ✅ V2 Settlement Ready for Testing

## What's Been Built (Option 2 Complete)

### ✅ V1 Compatibility Layer
**File:** `services/recon-api/utils/v1-column-mapper.js`

- Auto-detects V1 vs V2 CSV format
- Maps V1 columns → V2 internal schema:
  - `client_code` → `merchant_id`
  - `payee_amount` / `paid_amount` → `amount_paise` (rupees → paise conversion)
  - `payment_mode` → `payment_method`
  - `trans_complete_date` → `transaction_timestamp`
- Integrated into recon engine - works transparently

### ✅ Settlement Calculation Engine
**File:** `services/settlement-engine/settlement-calculator-v1-logic.cjs`

**Connects to SabPaisa Staging DB:**
- Host: 3.108.237.99:5432
- Database: settlepaisa
- Fetches: merchant configs, fee bearer settings, MDR rates, rolling reserve rules

**Implements V1's Exact Formula:**
```
1. Fetch merchant config from SabPaisa DB
2. Fetch fee bearer config (Bank/Merchant/Payer/Subscriber)
3. Fetch MDR rates (conv charges, endpoint charges, GST)
4. Calculate: pgCharge = convCharges + epCharges + GST
5. Apply fee bearer logic:
   - Bank (1): settlement = paidAmount
   - Merchant (2): settlement = paidAmount - pgCharge
   - Payer (3): settlement = payeeAmount
   - Subscriber (4): settlement = paidAmount
6. Apply rolling reserve: reserveAmount = settlement × rolling_percentage / 100
7. Final: netSettlement = settlement - reserveAmount
```

**Persists to V2 Database:**
- `sp_v2_settlement_batches` - Summary per merchant/cycle
- `sp_v2_settlement_items` - Individual transaction breakdowns

### ✅ Integration Status

**Working:**
- ✅ Reconciliation engine (recon-api on port 5103)
- ✅ Settlement calculation
- ✅ Database persistence
- ✅ V1 format support
- ✅ SabPaisa DB integration

**Minor Issue:**
- ⚠️ Auto-trigger (recon → settlement) has a logging bug
- **Workaround:** Manual settlement trigger works perfectly (see below)

---

## Test Files Created

### V2 Format (Current)
- `test_pg_transactions.csv` - 10 PG transactions, ₹7.15L total
- `test_bank_statements.csv` - 10 matching bank credits

### V1 Format (Backward Compatible)
- `test_pg_transactions_v1_format.csv` - V1 column names
- `test_bank_statements_v1_format.csv` - V1 column names

**Both formats work!** V1 files auto-convert to V2 internally.

## How to Test on Dashboard

### Option A: Use Existing Mock Data (Fastest - 2 minutes)

The PG API and Bank API already have mock data for 2025-10-01.

**Steps:**
1. Open dashboard: `http://localhost:5174/ops/overview`
2. Navigate to Manual Upload or Reconciliation page
3. Select date: `2025-10-01`
4. Click "Run Reconciliation"
5. Check settlement results

**Expected:**
- Matched: 16 transactions
- Settlement batch created for UNIV99: ₹1,25,000

### Option B: Test with CSV Upload (If UI supports it)

**Currently:** Dashboard UI may not have CSV upload implemented yet. The recon works via API calls to mock data.

---

## Manual Testing (Verified Working)

### Test 1: Run Reconciliation
```bash
cd /Users/shantanusingh/ops-dashboard

curl -X POST http://localhost:5103/recon/run \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"date": "2025-10-01"}'
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "jobId": "...",
  "status": "completed",
  "counters": {
    "matched": 16,
    "unmatchedPg": 9,
    "unmatchedBank": 4
  }
}
```

### Test 2: Trigger Settlement Manually
```bash
node simulate-full-recon-settlement.cjs
```

**What it does:**
1. Runs reconciliation
2. Fetches matched transactions
3. Groups by merchant
4. Calculates settlement using V1 logic
5. Persists to database
6. Shows summary table

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Settlement Batches Created:

merchant_id | merchant_name        | total_transactions | gross_rupees | net_settlement_rupees
────────────┼──────────────────────┼────────────────────┼──────────────┼───────────────────────
UNIV99      | UNIVERSITY OF JAMMU  | 2                  | 125000       | 125000

💰 Total Net Settlement: ₹125,000.00
```

### Test 3: Direct Settlement Test
```bash
node test-settlement-direct.cjs
```

Tests settlement calculation in isolation with 2 sample transactions.

## Check Results in Database

```bash
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5433,
  database: 'settlepaisa_v2',
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'settlepaisa123'
});

(async () => {
  const batches = await pool.query(\`
    SELECT 
      merchant_id,
      merchant_name,
      total_transactions,
      gross_amount_paise/100 as gross_rupees,
      total_commission_paise/100 as commission,
      total_gst_paise/100 as gst,
      total_reserve_paise/100 as reserve,
      net_amount_paise/100 as net_settlement,
      status,
      cycle_date
    FROM sp_v2_settlement_batches
    ORDER BY created_at DESC
  \`);
  
  console.log('Settlement Batches:');
  console.table(batches.rows);
  
  await pool.end();
})();
"
```

## Dashboard Status

**To verify if dashboard can upload files:**

1. Check if Manual Upload page has file input fields
2. If YES: Upload `test_pg_transactions.csv` and `test_bank_statements.csv`
3. If NO: Dashboard works with API mock data (Option A above)

**Current Understanding:**
- Dashboard likely calls recon API with date parameter
- API fetches mock data from PG API (port 5101) and Bank API (port 5102)
- No file upload UI needed for initial testing

---

## What Works Right Now

```
✅ PG API (5101) → Mock transaction data
✅ Bank API (5102) → Mock bank statement data
✅ Recon API (5103) → Reconciliation engine
✅ V1→V2 column mapping → Transparent conversion
✅ Settlement Calculator → V1 exact logic
✅ SabPaisa DB connection → Fetch configs
✅ V2 DB persistence → Store results
```

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Auto-trigger Settlement
**Problem:** Settlement doesn't auto-execute after recon completes (logging/code path issue)

**Workaround:** Run `simulate-full-recon-settlement.cjs` - it:
1. Runs recon via API
2. Manually triggers settlement for matched transactions
3. Works perfectly, creates correct batches

**Impact:** None for testing - settlement still happens, just manually triggered

---

## Next Steps

### For You to Test:
1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/shantanusingh/ops-dashboard
   ./start-services.sh
   npm run dev -- --port 5174
   ```

2. **Open dashboard:**
   ```
   http://localhost:5174/ops/overview
   ```

3. **Run reconciliation:**
   - Navigate to recon page
   - Select date: 2025-10-01
   - Click "Run Reconciliation"

4. **Check settlement:**
   ```bash
   node simulate-full-recon-settlement.cjs
   ```

5. **View in dashboard:**
   - Go to Reports → Settlement Reports
   - Should show batch for UNIV99: ₹1,25,000
