### Step 4: Download Reconciliation Results (2 min)

**What to do:**
1. Look for "Download Results CSV" button (top-right of results table)
2. Click the button
3. CSV file downloads automatically

**Filename format:** `recon-results-{jobId}-{tab}-{date}.csv`

**What to verify in CSV:**
- ✅ Headers: Transaction ID, UTR, RRN, Amount, Status, Reason, Date, Merchant, Payment Method, Bank

6. Drawer closes automatically

**What happens:**
- ✅ API call to `/exceptions/{id}/resolve`
- ✅ Transaction status changes from EXCEPTION → RECONCILED in database
- ✅ Exception disappears from list
- ✅ Overview dashboard metrics update (within 30 sec)

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check database directly
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5433,
  database: 'settlepaisa_v2',
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'settlepaisa123'
});

(async () => {
  const result = await pool.query(\`
    SELECT status, COUNT(*) 
    FROM sp_v2_transactions 
    GROUP BY status
  \`);
  console.table(result.rows);
  await pool.end();
})();
"
```

**Expected Result:**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Reconciliation doesn't start after upload

**Check:**
```bash
# Verify recon-api is running
curl http://localhost:5103/recon/health

# Check logs
tail -f /tmp/recon-api.log
```

**Fix:** Restart recon-api
```bash
kill -9 $(lsof -ti :5103)
node index.js > /tmp/recon-api.log 2>&1 &
```

### Issue: Export button not appearing

**Check:**
- Both files uploaded?
- jobId is set?
- reconResults has data?

**Debug in browser console:**
```javascript
// Check state
console.log('jobId:', jobId)
console.log('reconResults length:', reconResults.length)
```

### Issue: Exception resolve doesn't work

**Check:**
```bash
# Test API directly
curl -X POST http://localhost:5103/exceptions/{exceptionId}/resolve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"resolvedBy": "test_user"}'
```

**Verify database:**
```bash
psql postgresql://postgres:settlepaisa123@localhost:5433/settlepaisa_v2 \
  -c "SELECT id, status FROM sp_v2_transactions WHERE id = {exceptionId}"
```

### Issue: Reports not downloading

**Check:**
- Overview API running? `curl http://localhost:5105/health`
- Network tab in browser shows 200 response?
- Console errors?

## 📊 Expected Test Results

### Database State After Full Test:

**Transactions:**
- Initial: 6
- After upload: 26 (6 + 20 new)

  - RECONCILED: ~21 (16 matched + some resolved)
  - EXCEPTION: ~5 (4 unmatched - resolved ones)

**Bank Statements:**
- Initial: 3
- After upload: 19 (3 + 16 new)

**Recon Matches:**
- Initial: 227
- After upload: 243 (227 + 16 new matches)

### Verify with SQL:

```bash
node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({
  host: 'localhost',
  port: 5433,
  database: 'settlepaisa_v2',
  user: 'postgres',
  password: 'settlepaisa123'
});

(async () => {
  console.log('\\n📊 DATABASE STATE AFTER TESTING:\\n');
  
  const txns = await pool.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sp_v2_transactions');
  console.log('Transactions:', txns.rows[0].count);
  
  const bank = await pool.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sp_v2_bank_statements');
  console.log('Bank Statements:', bank.rows[0].count);
  
  const matches = await pool.query('SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sp_v2_recon_matches');
  console.log('Matches:', matches.rows[0].count);
  
  const statusBreakdown = await pool.query('SELECT status, COUNT(*) FROM sp_v2_transactions GROUP BY status');
  console.log('\\nStatus Breakdown:');
  console.table(statusBreakdown.rows);
  
  await pool.end();
})();
"
```
