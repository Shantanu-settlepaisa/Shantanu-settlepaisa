## Architecture

### Tables Created:

1. **sp_v2_merchant_settlement_config** - Merchant settlement configurations
   - Settlement frequency (daily/weekly/monthly)
   - Bank account details
   - Auto-settle preferences
   - Min settlement amount

2. **sp_v2_settlement_schedule_runs** - Audit trail of all settlement runs
   - Run statistics (merchants, batches, amounts)
   - Error tracking
   - Execution time metrics

3. **sp_v2_settlement_approvals** - Multi-level approval workflow
   - Approver details
   - Decision tracking (approved/rejected/on_hold)
   - Manager approval support

4. **sp_v2_bank_transfer_queue** - Bank transfer management
   - Transfer modes (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS/UPI)
   - UTR tracking
   - Retry logic (max 3 retries)
   - API request/response storage

5. **sp_v2_settlement_transaction_map** - Transaction-to-batch mapping

6. **sp_v2_settlement_errors** - Error tracking and resolution

### Services Created:

#### 1. Settlement Calculator V2
**File:** `/services/settlement-engine/settlement-calculator-v2.cjs`

**Features:**
- Local merchant config lookup (V2 database)
- MDR calculation (2% default)
- GST calculation (18% on fees)
- Rolling reserve support
- Batch and item persistence

**Calculation Logic:**
```
Commission = Amount × 2%
GST = Commission × 18%
Settlement Before Reserve = Amount - Commission - GST
Rolling Reserve = Settlement × Reserve%
Final Settlement = Settlement - Reserve
```

#### 2. Settlement Scheduler
**File:** `/services/settlement-engine/settlement-scheduler.cjs`

**Features:**
- Cron job (daily at 11 PM): `0 23 * * *`
- Merchant frequency support (daily/weekly/monthly)
- Transaction grouping by cycle date
- Bank transfer queue management
- Comprehensive error handling

**Transfer Mode Logic:**
- Amount ≥ ₹2,00,000 → RTGS
- Amount < ₹2,00,000 + IMPS preferred → IMPS
- Default → NEFT

#### 3. Manual Settlement Trigger
**File:** `/services/settlement-engine/manual-settlement-trigger.cjs`

**Usage:**
```bash
# Settle all merchants for date range
node manual-settlement-trigger.cjs --from 2025-09-22 --to 2025-10-01

# Settle specific merchant
node manual-settlement-trigger.cjs --merchant MERCH001

# Settle all pending (no date filter)
node manual-settlement-trigger.cjs
```

## Settlement Workflow

### Automated Flow (Production):
```
1. Cron triggers at 11 PM daily
   ↓
2. Scheduler queries merchant configs
   - Filter by settlement_frequency
   - Get eligible merchants
   ↓
3. For each merchant:
   - Fetch RECONCILED transactions
   - Group by transaction_date
   - Run settlement calculation
   ↓
4. Create settlement batches
   - Insert into sp_v2_settlement_batches
   - Insert items into sp_v2_settlement_items
   - Update transactions with batch_id
   ↓
5. Queue bank transfers (if auto_settle = true)
   - Determine transfer mode (NEFT/RTGS/IMPS)
   - Insert into sp_v2_bank_transfer_queue
   ↓
6. Log run results
   - Update sp_v2_settlement_schedule_runs
   - Track errors in sp_v2_settlement_errors
```

### Manual Flow:
```
Admin runs: node manual-settlement-trigger.cjs --from X --to Y
    ↓
Same as automated flow (steps 2-6)
```

## Configuration

### Merchant Settlement Config:
```sql
INSERT INTO sp_v2_merchant_settlement_config (
  merchant_id,
  settlement_frequency, -- daily|weekly|monthly|on_demand
  settlement_day,       -- 1-7 for weekly, 1-31 for monthly
  auto_settle,          -- true|false
  min_settlement_amount_paise,
  account_number,
  ifsc_code,
  preferred_transfer_mode
) VALUES (...);
```

### Seeded Merchants:
- MERCH001, MERCH002, MERCH003
- MERCHANT_001, MERCHANT_002, MERCHANT_003
- TEST_MERCHANT

All configured for:
- Daily settlement at 11 PM
- Auto-settle: true
- Min amount: ₹100
- Transfer mode: NEFT

## Pending Implementation (Documented for Later)

### 1. Approval Workflow ⏳
**Reminder:** User requested to implement later

**Plan:**
- Admin dashboard for batch approval
- Email notifications to approvers
- Multi-level approval support
- Batch editing/rejection

**API Endpoints to Add:**
```
POST /settlements/approve/:batchId
POST /settlements/reject/:batchId
GET /settlements/pending-approval
```

### 2. NEFT/RTGS API Integration ⏳
**Current:** Transfers queued in database
**Next:** Integrate with bank APIs

**Options Explored:**
- RazorPay Payouts API
- Cashfree Payouts
- Direct bank SFTP integration
- NPCI API integration

**Recommendation:** Start with RazorPay Payouts for quick MVP

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites:
1. Merchant configs populated in sp_v2_merchant_settlement_config
2. Bank account details verified
3. Settlement frequency configured per merchant
4. Cron job enabled on server

### Start Scheduler:
```bash
cd services/settlement-engine
node settlement-scheduler.cjs
```

This will:
- Start cron job (daily at 11 PM)
- Listen for SIGINT to gracefully shutdown
- Log all runs to sp_v2_settlement_schedule_runs

### Monitor:
```sql
-- Check latest runs
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_settlement_schedule_runs 
ORDER BY run_timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check errors
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_settlement_errors 
WHERE is_resolved = false;

-- Check pending transfers
SELECT * FROM sp_v2_bank_transfer_queue 
WHERE status IN ('queued', 'processing');
```

## Merchant Dashboard Impact

**Note from User:** "There is a merchant dashboard also which will get powered up by V2 settlepaisa only. So that why option B is a must."

### Settlement Data Available for Merchant Dashboard:
- Settlement batches per merchant
- Transaction-level breakdown
- Fee/GST/TDS details
- Bank transfer status
- Settlement timeline
- Downloadable reports

### API Endpoints for Merchant Portal:
```
GET /merchants/:merchantId/settlements
GET /merchants/:merchantId/settlements/:batchId
GET /merchants/:merchantId/bank-transfers
GET /merchants/:merchantId/settlement-schedule
```
