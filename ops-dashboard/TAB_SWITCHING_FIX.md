# Tab Switching Fix for Reconciliation Results

## Issue
When switching between tabs (All, Matched, Unmatched PG, Unmatched Bank, Exceptions), the Exceptions tab was showing mixed data - both Unmatched Bank entries and Exception entries instead of only Exception entries.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. React Query caching stale data between tab switches
2. Race conditions when switching tabs quickly
3. Mock data using duplicate transaction IDs with different statuses

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Query Invalidation (useReconJobSummary.ts)
- Added extensive logging to track API calls
- Set `staleTime: 0` and `gcTime: 0` to prevent caching
- Set `refetchOnMount: 'always'` to force fresh data
- Added `networkMode: 'always'` to ensure network fetch

### 2. Added Tab Change Flag (ManualUploadEnhanced.tsx)
- Introduced `isTabChanging` state flag to track tab transitions
- Clear results immediately when tab changes
- Invalidate React Query cache on tab change using `queryClient.invalidateQueries`
- Prevent updates while tab is changing to avoid race conditions
- Pass empty array to table component during tab transitions

### 3. Enhanced Data Flow Control
- Only update results when not in the middle of a tab change
- Added validation to ensure results match the expected tab filter
- Clear results before fetching new data to prevent showing stale data

## Files Modified
1. `/src/hooks/useReconJobSummary.ts` - Enhanced React Query configuration
2. `/src/components/ManualUploadEnhanced.tsx` - Added tab change management
3. `/src/components/recon/ReconResultsTable.tsx` - Already has proper filtering logic

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Upload sample files
2. Click on Exceptions tab - should show only Exception entries
3. Click on other tabs (All, Unmatched Bank, etc.)
4. Return to Exceptions tab - should still show only Exception entries
5. Repeat switching between tabs to ensure consistency

## Note
The mock API returns duplicate transaction IDs with different statuses, which is the underlying data issue. The fix ensures the UI properly handles this by clearing and refreshing data on each tab switch.
